# Predict-Hospital-LOS
Predicting the Length of Stay of hospital patients using the MIMIC- III Dataset.

# 1: Overview
## 1.1: Why?

It's important to predict hospital length of stay (LOS, los) for a number of reasons, such as improving patient flow, Increasing healthcare efficiency (both inpatient and outpatient), saving money in the hospital system, and improving outcomes for patients.

This project is my masters thesis project for my Data Science postgrad at the University of Aberdeen. This is not the thesis itself, but instead supplementary information. I will try to keep a degree of professionalism here, but this file explaining is likely to be significantly more casual than any academic writing I do on the topic.

## 1.2: What?

The mimic -III dataset is a popular dataset for studies on hospital patients as it's large, broad, and freely accessible (mostly). There are a large number of different tables, which include numerous datapoints from all across the hospital. We will be using and selecting a wide variety of these data to use in our experimentation,
and hopefully produce a lean, fast and effective machine learning model which will be able to somewhat accurately predict an  unseen patients los.
